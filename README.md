# CS-170-Project-2
Ppart 1 of CS 170 Project 2 where we implement two greedy feature searches of forward selection and backward elimination. Both will use an evaluation function of a random number for now.

Part 2 is first creating the classifier class and the validator class 
Part 3 is the last part of the project where we replace our stub evaluation function with the validate class
